# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project
This basic project aims to perform sentiment analysis on amazon customer reviews using pre-trained models.

The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
## Process
Sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and extracting the subjective information from text, in this case - amazon reviews.

1. import the required libraries
2. load dataset
3. Explore the data
4. Initiate and apply pre-trained VADER and roBERTa models to the dataset
5. Evalulate and compare models

## Future Goals
This project was following a tutorial, in the future I would like to do a project on my own using my own dataset of choice and even develop my own model instead of using pre-trained ones
